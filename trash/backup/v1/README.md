# Provest Codebase

Welcome to the Provest codebase! This repository houses the core components of our decentralized application, including the frontend built with Next.js and the Solidity smart contract deployed on the Polygon Amoy testnet.

## Description

Provest is designed to provide a seamless and secure experience for users interacting with blockchain technology. The frontend application serves as the interface, allowing users to interact with our Solidity smart contract, which handles the backend logic and transactions on the Polygon network.

## Project Structure

This repository contains three main parts:

1. **Frontend (Next.js App)**
   - The frontend is built using Next.js, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface for interacting with the blockchain.
   
2. **Solidity Smart Contract**
   - Our smart contract, written in Solidity, manages the core functionality of the application. It is deployed on the Polygon Amoy testnet.
   - **Contract Address:** [0x2e330a355e95A0DEd08Eba431Df94cD2c1d27bCe](https://amoy.polygonscan.com/address/0x2e330a355e95A0DEd08Eba431Df94cD2c1d27bCe)

## Usage

To use this codebase, follow these steps:

### Frontend (Next.js App)
1. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

### Solidity Smart Contract
1. The smart contract is already deployed on the Polygon Amoy testnet.
2. You can track the contract's activities using the following link: [Polygon Amoy Explorer](https://amoy.polygonscan.com/address/0x2e330a355e95A0DEd08Eba431Df94cD2c1d27bCe).
